I think i made some good desktop tools which can be helpful so wanted to share here

# Be aware

You have to use this tool very carefully because moving all files and deleting all files are very risky. Dont use moving all files and deleting all files till u really want it because it can do harm to your system specially deleting all files.

# Use 

U can make a new folder in visual studio code and just put these files and run the main.py.
Note - tools.py should be in the same folder as main.py for requirments download Pyside6.
